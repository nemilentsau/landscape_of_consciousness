## Decision framework: what earns a test

Before writing anything, answer these questions:

**1. What are the branches?**
List every `if`/`elif`/`else` and every early return. Each branch is one required test.

**2. Where are the boundaries?**
Every `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<` comparison earns *two* tests: one at exactly the limit, one on each side.

**3. What are the failure modes?**
Error paths are at least as important as happy paths.

**4. Does complexity scale with test count?**
Simple functions with no branching may need zero tests. Complex logic needs many.

**5. Would deleting this test let a regression slip through?**
If another test already covers the same branch and boundary, delete one.

## What NOT to test

**LLM outputs** — test what happens *given* certain outputs, not that the LLM was called.

**Prompt content** — asserting a prompt string contains specific text is brittle.

**That a mock was called** — assert on *outcomes*: return values, side effects, errors.

---

## Equivalence classes, not examples

One test per branch + two tests per boundary. Delete any parametrize case that exercises the same branch as another.

## Filesystem and startup code

For watcher, ingest, cache invalidation, or startup reconciliation code, happy-path tests are not enough.

You must cover these states explicitly:

- **Missing output** — work should run when extracted files or derived state do not exist yet.
- **Already in sync** — a second run with unchanged inputs must be a no-op.
- **Stale output** — changed source input must refresh or replace previously derived output.
- **Error path** — invalid archives, missing directories, or other failure cases must not corrupt state.

For code that runs on app startup or in a file watcher, add an **idempotence** test unless the code is intentionally non-idempotent. "Works once" is insufficient; regressions often show up on the second run.

If a change affects real filesystem layout or startup behavior, do a local smoke check against a realistic data tree before closing the task. Unit tests do not replace that check.

## Test naming

Name tests after the **behaviour under test**, not the function:

```python
# BAD
def test_execute_python():

# GOOD
def test_syntax_error_populates_error_field():
def test_timeout_populates_error_field():
```

---

## Running tests

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
